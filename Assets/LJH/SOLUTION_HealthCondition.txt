# Final Solution for HealthBelowThresholdCondition Error

## Quick Solution

The error occurs because Unity hasn't properly imported the `HealthBelowThresholdCondition.cs` file. Here's the fastest fix:

### In Unity Editor:

1. **Right-click** on the folder: `Assets/LJH/BehaviorTree/Nodes/Conditions`
2. Select **"Reimport"**
3. Wait for Unity to finish (check the progress bar at bottom)
4. The error should disappear

## Alternative Solutions (if above doesn't work)

### Option 1: Use the Menu Tool
- Go to Unity menu: **BehaviorTree > Fix Import Issues**
- This will force reimport all BehaviorTree scripts

### Option 2: Manual Asset Refresh
- Press **Ctrl+R** (or Cmd+R on Mac) in Unity
- Or go to **Assets > Refresh**

### Option 3: Full Project Reimport
1. Right-click on `Assets/LJH` folder
2. Select **"Reimport All"**
3. Wait for completion (this takes longer but is thorough)

## Why This Happens

Unity sometimes fails to recognize new scripts when:
- Files are created while Unity is in Safe Mode
- Files are created outside Unity (via external editors)
- Script compilation order gets confused
- The asset database cache is outdated

## File Location Verification

The file exists at:
```
Assets/LJH/BehaviorTree/Nodes/Conditions/HealthBelowThresholdCondition.cs
```

You can verify this by:
1. Opening the Project window in Unity
2. Navigating to: LJH > BehaviorTree > Nodes > Conditions
3. You should see `HealthBelowThresholdCondition` listed

## What the File Does

`HealthBelowThresholdCondition` is a condition node that:
- Checks if the agent's health is below a specified percentage
- Returns SUCCESS if health is below threshold
- Returns FAILURE if health is above threshold
- Used by OffensiveAgent for emergency retreat behavior

## If Nothing Works

As a last resort:
1. Close Unity completely
2. Delete the `Library` folder in your project root (Unity will rebuild it)
3. Reopen Unity
4. Unity will reimport all assets (this takes time but fixes most issues)

## Prevention Tips

To avoid this in the future:
- Always create new scripts using Unity's "Create > C# Script" menu
- Exit Safe Mode before adding new scripts
- Use version control to track file changes
- Regularly refresh the asset database (Ctrl+R)

The script is properly written and should work once Unity recognizes it. This is purely an import/compilation issue, not a code problem.
